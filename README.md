# BossBar API
This repo contains two classes:
- One to get all the NMS and CraftBukkit classes and get methods and fields in them
- The other one to send packages, which also contains user friendly methods

Notice: I used most of SoThatsIt's classes, which can be found [here](https://forums.bukkit.org/threads/tutorial-utilizing-the-boss-health-bar.158018/page-3)
